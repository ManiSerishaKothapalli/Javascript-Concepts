ES5 features to create object

1)Constructor functions object creation


1)Creation of objects using javascript classes: Classes has been introduced in ES6 like other
Programming languages.But they work different, they are used to create objects in easy way and
also can inherit other classes using extend.

class Student{
    constructor(name,age,rollnum){
        this.name=name;
        this.age=age;
        this.rollnum=rollnum;
    }


    getname(){
        console.log(this.name)
    }
}


let student1 = new Student("seri",24,12)
console.log(student1.name,student1.getname())


2)Constructor functions object creation:
function Student(name,age){
            this.name=name,
            this.age=age,

//You can't use functions without assigning to variable in constructor functions
            this.details = () => {
                return `He is ${this.name} with age ${this.age}`
            }
        }

        let student1 = new Student("john",22)
        console.log(student1.details());

DIFFERENCE BETWEEN CLASSES AND CONSTRUCTOR FUNCTIONS:
_____________________________________________________

1)One difference is that using constructor functions we can't use inheritance
2)Adding functions to classes is bit more convinient.
